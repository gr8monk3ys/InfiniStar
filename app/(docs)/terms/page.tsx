          the Site: With respect to the content or other materials you upload to
          or create using the Services (collectively, &quot;User Content&quot;), you
          represent and warrant that you own all rights, titles and interests in
          and to such User Content, including, without limitation, all
          copyrights and rights of publicity contained therein, or are otherwise
          permitted to use them for the applicable purposes, for example by
          license or legal exception or limitation. By creating or uploading any
          User Content you own or create using the Service, you retain all
          rights in it (to the extent you would otherwise hold such rights) and
          hereby grant and will grant Infinistar to the fullest extent permitted
          under the law a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid up,
          transferable, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to copy,
          display, upload, perform, distribute, store, modify and otherwise use
          your User Content for any Infinistar-related purpose in any form,
          medium or technology now known or later developed. Characters and
          Generations: For any automated AI character (&apos;Character&apos;) that you
          create or upload using the Service, you own all rights in that
          Character (and to the extent you create derivative works, you own all
          rights you otherwise would own in them) and any text, images or video
          it generates (&apos;Generations&apos;) that are elicited directly or indirectly

          the Character you created and any related Generations for any purpose
          in any form, medium or technology now known or later developed. For
          the avoidance of doubt, violations of Infinistar&apos;s Acceptable Use
          Policy unrelated to intellectual property issues do not affect the
          user&apos;s intellectual property rights in any Characters or their
          Generations. Website or Services Content, Software, and Trademarks:
          You acknowledge and agree that the Website or Services may contain
          content or features (&quot;Site Content&quot;) that are protected by copyright,
          patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights and laws.
          In connection with your use of the Website or Services, you will not
          engage in or use any data mining, robots, scraping, or similar
          automated data gathering or extraction methods. If you are blocked by
          Infinistar from accessing the Website or Services (including by
          blocking your IP address), you agree not to implement any measures to
          circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP address or using a
          proxy IP address). Any use of the Website or Services, or the Site
          Content, other than as specifically authorized herein, is strictly
          prohibited. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by
          Infinistar. Third-Party Material: Under no circumstances will
          Infinistar be liable in any way for any content or materials of any
          third parties, including Joyland bots created by third parties and any
          Generations resulting from such Joyland bots, including, but not
          limited to infringement of intellectual property rights, for any
          errors or omissions in any content, or for any loss or damage of any
          kind incurred as a result of the use of any such content. You
          acknowledge that Infinistar does not pre-screen content, but that
          Infinistar and its designees will have the right (but not the
          obligation) in their sole discretion to refuse or remove any content
          that is available via the Website or Services. Without limiting the
          foregoing, Infinistar and its designees will have the right to remove
          any content that violates these Terms, our AUP, or is deemed by
          Infinistar, in its sole discretion, to be otherwise objectionable. You
          agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the
          use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy,
          completeness, or usefulness of such content. You acknowledge and agree
          that any questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, feedback or other
          information about the Website or Services (&quot;Submissions&quot;) provided by
          you to Infinistar are non-confidential and Infinistar will be entitled
          to the unrestricted use and dissemination of these Submissions for any
          purpose, without acknowledgment of or compensation to you. Without
          limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that Infinistar may
          preserve content and may also disclose content and/or metadata if
          required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such
          preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with
          legal process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce
          these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the
          rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or
          personal safety of Infinistar, its users and the public. You
          understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
          Website and Services, including your content, may involve (a)
          transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and
          adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
          Copyright Complaints: Infinistar respects the intellectual property of
          others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that your
          work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement,
          or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise
          violated, you can notify Infinistar of your infringement claim by
          email.support@joyland.ai To be effective, email notifications must

          work or other intellectual property rights that you claim to have been
          infringed upon; A description of the location of the material you

          in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or
          intellectual property owner or authorized to act on behalf of the
          copyright or intellectual property owner. Counter-Notice. If you
          believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access
          was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization
          from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&apos;s agent, or pursuant to
          the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may
          send a written counter-notice containing the following information to
          the Copyright Agent: your physical or electronic signature;
          identification of the content that has been removed or to which access
          has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared
          before it was removed or disabled; a statement that you have a good
          faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of
          mistake or a misidentification of the content; and your name, address,

          the jurisdiction of the federal court located within the Northern
          District of California and a statement that you will accept service of
          process from the person who provided notification of the alleged
          infringement. If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent,
          Infinistar will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original
          complaining party informing that person that it may replace the
          removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the
          copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the
          content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced,
          or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
          receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion. Third Party
          Websites and Services The Services may provide, or third parties may
          provide, links or other access to other sites and resources on the
          Internet or to third-party applications. Infinistar has no control
          over such sites, resources, or applications and Infinistar is not
          responsible for and does not endorse such sites, resources, or
          applications. You further acknowledge and agree that Infinistar will
          not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage
          or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the
          use of or reliance on any content, events, goods, or services
          available on or through any such sites, resources or applications. Any
          dealings you have with third parties found while using the Services
          are between you and the third party, and you agree that Infinistar is
          not liable for any loss or claim that you may have against any such
          third party. Limitation of Liability You expressly understand and
          agree that Infinistar will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
          special, consequential, exemplary damages, or damages for loss of
          profits including but not limited to, damages for loss of goodwill,
          use, data or other intangible losses (even if Infinistar has been
          advised of the possibility of such damages), whether based on
          contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, resulting
          from: (I) the use or the inability to use the Services or any related
          information; (ii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your
          transmissions or data; (iii) statements or conduct of any third party
          (including users) on the Services; or (iv) any other matter relating
          to the Services. In no event will Infinistar&apos;s total liability to you
          for all damages, losses, or causes of action exceed one hundred
          dollars ($100). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of
          certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for
          incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above
          limitations set forth above may not apply to you. If you are
          dissatisfied with any portion of the site or with these terms of use,
          your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue the use of the
          Services. Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration This section
          affects your rights so please read it carefully. Agreement to
          Arbitrate This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section of
          the Terms is referred to in these Terms as the &quot;Arbitration
          Agreement.&quot; You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have
          arisen or may arise between you and Infinistar, whether arising out of
          or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the
          Website or Services, any aspect of the relationship or transactions
          between us, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding
          arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this
          Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in
          small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration
          Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
          of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the
          law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
          entering into these Terms, you and Infinistar are each waiving the
          right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your
          rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or
          jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
          enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Prohibition of Class and
          Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief You and
          Infinistar agree that each of us may bring claims against the other
          only on an individual basis and not as a plaintiff or class member in
          any purported class or representative action or proceeding. Unless
          both You and Infinistar agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
          consolidate or join more than one person&apos;s or party&apos;s claims and may
          not otherwise preside over any form of a consolidated, representative,
          or class proceeding. Also, the arbitrator may award relief (including
          monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the
          individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to
          provide relief necessitated by that party&apos;s individual claim(s).
          Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution Infinistar is always interested in
          resolving disputes amicably and fairly, so if you have concerns, we
          strongly encourage you to first email us about them at
          support@joyland.ai. The email must (i) describe the nature and basis
          of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.
          If Infinistar and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60)
          calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Infinistar may
          commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount
          of any settlement offered by Infinistar or you shall not be disclosed
          to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if
          any, to which you or Infinistar are entitled. Termination You agree
          that Infinistar, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your
          account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services and remove and
          discard any content within the Website or Services, for any reason,
          including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Infinistar
          believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the
          letter or spirit of these Terms or Infinistar&apos;s Acceptable Use Policy.
          Infinistar may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue
          providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice.
          You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under
          any provision of these Terms or our AUP may be effected without prior
          notice, and acknowledge and agree that Infinistar may (but has no
          obligation to) immediately deactivate or delete your account and all
          related information and files in your account and/or bar any further
          access to such files or the Services. Termination of your account or
          access to any component of the Services will not terminate
          Infinistar&apos;s rights to your User Content. Further, you agree that
          Infinistar will not be liable to you or any third party for any
          termination of your access to the Services. General Entire Agreement:
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Infinistar
          and govern your use of our Services, superseding any prior agreements
          between you and Infinistar with respect to the Services. Choice of
          Law, Jurisdiction, Venue: These terms are governed by the laws of the
          state of Delaware without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
          With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as
          set forth above, you and Infinistar agree to submit to the personal
          and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
          within the state of Delaware. Severance: If any provision of these
          Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the
          parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
          effect to the parties&apos; intentions as reflected in the provision, and
          the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.
          No Waiver: Any failure of Infinistar to exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of these terms does not constitute a waiver of such right
          or provision. Expiration of Claims: You agree that regardless of any
